# ✨ Starchive – VR Constellation Creator

🎥 **Demo Video:** [Watch here](https://youtu.be/qm9Vp8hmd7k)

**Starchive** (short for **Star Archive**) is an original VR experience built in **Unity 6** with the **XR Interaction Toolkit**.  
Created by **Meredith de la Torre** for *Building Virtual Worlds* (CIM 423) at the **University of Miami**, Spring 2025.

In Starchive you wield a magical bow to draw constellations on a board, then launch them into the night sky. When your celestial artwork is complete, you awaken in your bedroom to reflect on the stars you’ve set free.

| **Hit a circle** | Circle lights up; a line is drawn between consecutive hits to form your constellation. |
| **Press the “Finish” button** | Locks your current pattern and waits for the next arrow. |
| **Shoot into the sky** | Your constellation appears overhead, glowing and connected exactly as drawn. |
| **Complete the finale arrow** | Scene transitions to a cozy bedroom where the experience ends. |
